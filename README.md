# Postjoy

Postal codes made easy

## Get Started

Add this line to your applicationâ€™s Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'postjoy'
```

Lookup postal code

```ruby
Postjoy.find(94109)
# =>
{
  city: "San Francisco",
  state: "California",
  state_code: "CA",
  latitude: 37.7917,
  longitude: -122.4186
}
```

Returns `nil` if the postal code does not exist

## Validations

Also adds validations for Rails

```ruby
class Address < ActiveRecord::Base
  validates :postal_code, postal_code: true
end
```

## Update Postal Codes

Download updated list from [GeoNames](http://download.geonames.org/export/zip/)

Once you have updated `US.txt` with the new file build the `postal_codes.dump` with the following command

```ruby
rake create
```
